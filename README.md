# Habitable_Exoplanets

This project focuses on using ML to analyze data from the NASA exoplanet archive and predict whether a given exoplanet will be habitable for humans. By analyzing planetary features such as mass, radius, surface temperature, orbital period, and planet type, the model predicts whether a given exoplanet may be habitable for humans. As the discovery of exoplanets continues to grow exponentially, identifying exoplanets that could potentially support life is of great importance to both astronomers and the broader scientific community.

## Some Quick Facts

'''
1. What is an exoplanet?
'''
An exoplanet is any planet that resides outside our Solar System. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered since the 1990s, and scientists continue to find more using space telescopes like Kepler and TESS.

'''
2. What is planetary habitability and the Habitable Zone?
'''
Planetary habitability refers to the potential of a planet to support life as we know it, especially life that requires liquid water. A habitable planet must possess the right combination of environmental conditions, including temperature, atmospheric composition, and the presence of liquid water. The Habitable Zone (AKA the Goldilocks Zone) around a star is the region where conditions are just right for liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. This depends on the star’s type, size, and luminosity.

3. What are the basic physics factors behind determining if a planet is habitable or not?
'''
The mass and radius of a planet are key factors in determining its gravity, atmosphere, and potential surface conditions. They help astronomers/astrophysicists infer whether a planet could support an atmosphere and maintain liquid water. 

The orbital period is the time a planet takes to complete one orbit around its host star. This affects the planet's climate and seasonal patterns, which are critical in determining habitability. For reference, Earth's orbital period around the Sun is 365.256 days.

Surface temperature is influenced by a planet’s distance from its star and its atmosphere. It plays a critical role in determining whether liquid water can exist on the planet’s surface.

Planets are classified based on their mass and size. For example, superterran planets are larger than Earth but smaller than gas giants (like Jupiter), and may have Earth-like characteristics, making them candidates for habitability. There are multiple different types of exoplanets, including Gas Giants, Neptunians, Super-Earths, and Terrestrials.

## The Search For Habitable Exoplanets

The search for habitable exoplanets has become one of the most exciting fields in astronomy. Astronomers estimate that there are billions of planets in our galaxy alone, and among them, a small fraction may reside in the habitable zone, where conditions could allow liquid water to exist, a key ingredient for life. However, the habitability of a planet depends on many other factors, such as its atmospheric composition, stellar radiation, and geological features.

While some research focuses on discovering planets within this zone, this project aims to go a step further by combining machine learning with astrophysical data to predict a planet's habitability based on multiple variables. By using known exoplanet data and characteristics of habitable planets in our solar system, we can create a model to assess habitability more accurately than just relying on distance from the host star.

As our knowledge of exoplanets grows, the ability to identify potentially habitable worlds becomes increasingly important for both future exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life. This project not only provides a method for evaluating habitability but also offers a foundation for future research, incorporating stellar activity and atmospherics into the prediction process. This project aims to create a comprehensive model that can assist in prioritizing targets for future space missions and telescope observations.
